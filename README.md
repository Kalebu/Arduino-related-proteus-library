# Proteus Arduino libraries 

A word of motivation
----------------------
I have background in **mechatronics** and once upon a time were doing a lot of proteus simulation together with arduino micro-contollers, one of the things I found annoying was downloading other device libraries to integrate together with arduino board, sites to download those libraries has a lot of ads and a lot of redirecting.

So thus lead me to open this repo to act as an archive for arduino-related proteus libraries so that I don't have to deal with ads next time I want a library.


Libraries 
-----------------
I found organize a bunch libraries that I was able to download into category from **sensors** to **Micro-controllers** just as shown below;

- [Arduino](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/Arduino) 
- [Actuators and Drivers](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/actuators%20and%20drivers)
- [Display devices Libraries](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/display-devices%20libraries)
- [I2C Modules Libraries](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/I2C%20Modules)
- [Sensors Libraries](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/Sensors%20Libraries)
- [Wireless Devices Libraries](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/Wireless%20devices%20Libraries)
- [Others](https://github.com/Kalebu/Proteus-arduino-libraries/tree/master/others)

Gota a another libary ?
-----------------------
If you have gota any other libraries that is not listed on this repo, you're warmly welcome to contribute, what you need to do is just;

- Fork the Repository
- Addd your new libary 
- Issue a Pull request

And as long as the libary relevant, I will merge your pull request as soon as possible
